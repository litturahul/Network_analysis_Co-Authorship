Acquisition Values and Optimal Financial (In)Flexibility.,"Hege, Ulrich; Hennessy, Christopher",Review of Financial Studies,08939454,,Jul2010,23,7,2865,35,51648797,,Oxford University Press / USA,Article,FINANCE; Financial research; Corporate debt -- Ratings & rankings; Corporate finance; Debt financing (Corporations); First-mover advantage; Venture capital; Consumer Lending; Consolidation & merger of corporations,,"This article analyzes optimal financial contracts for an incumbent and potential entrant accounting for prospective asset mergers. Exercising a first-mover advantage, the incumbent increases his share of surplus by issuing public debt that appreciates in the event of merger. Incumbent debt reduces the equilibrium value of entrant assets and thus reduces the return to (likelihood of) entry through two channels: venture capitalists recover less in default and ownership rights provide weaker managerial incentives. High incumbent leverage has a countervailing cost, since the resulting debt overhang prevents ex post efficient mergers if merger surplus is low. Event risk covenants limiting counterparty debt are optimal for the incumbent, further limiting the entrant's share of merger surplus. A poison-put covenant is also optimal for the incumbent, allowing him to extract the same surplus with lower debt face value.",FT50,Y
Considerations for a Stronger First Mover Advantage Theory.,"Suarez, Fernando F.; Lanzolla, Gianvito",Academy of Management Review,03637425,,Jan2008,33,1,269,2,27752960,10.5465/AMR.2008.27752960,Academy of Management,Article,First-mover advantage; Market share; New product development; Marketing; Business research; Time to market (New products); Business literature; Business planning; Strategic planning; Product management research; Commercial products; Research and Development in the Social Sciences and Humanities; Commodity Contracts Dealing; Commodity Contracts Brokerage; Marketing Consulting Services; Competition; Research methodology,,"In this article the authors answer a critique, published elsewhere in the magazine, of their article ""The Role of Environmental Dynamics in Building a First Mover Advantage Theory.""

First mover advantage through franchising,"Michael, Steven C.",Journal of Business Venturing,08839026,,Jan2003,18,1,61,20,8723846,,Elsevier B.V.,Article,Franchises (Retail trade); Restaurants; Service industries; All other miscellaneous general merchandise stores; All Other Miscellaneous Store Retailers (except Tobacco Stores); All other miscellaneous store retailers (except beer and wine-making supplies stores); All other building equipment contractors; Commercial and Institutional Building Construction; Full-Service Restaurants; Service Establishment Equipment and Supplies Merchant Wholesalers,First mover advantage; Franchising; Organizational form; Restaurant industry,"Franchising has been argued to be a technique for entrepreneurs in service industries to assemble resources in order to rapidly create large chains and gain first mover advantage. Whether and how such first mover advantage is created is the subject of this paper. Using theories from strategic management and marketing, it is argued that the first mover advantage initially takes the form of a lead in the number of retail outlets, followed by a market share lead, and, finally, superior profitability. A structural equations model is specified, and empirical results from the restaurant industry support the model''s predictions. Implications for research and practice are discussed.",FT50,Y

First-Mover Advantage Through Distribution: A Decomposition Approach.,"Nishida, Mitsukuni",Marketing Science,07322399,,Jul/Aug2017,36,4,590,20,124453064,10.1287/mksc.2017.1029,INFORMS: Institute for Operations Research,Article,Endogeneity (Econometrics); Convenience Stores; Market share -- Economic aspects; Instrumental variables (Statistics); Selling ability testing; Convenience stores -- Economic aspects,chain; convenience store; distribution; first-mover advantage; IV estimation; market share; order of entry; pioneering advantage; retailing,"Whereas the extant literature on entry-order effects establishes that first entrants often earn higher market shares ('market-share advantage'), the literature on distribution suggests that increased distribution has a positive effect on sales. Can distribution help us better understand entry-order effects on market shares? This paper examines how the first entrant in a geographical market achieves a market-share advantage through distribution. For this purpose, I propose a simple method of decomposing sales into physical distribution and sales performance. The data come from a manually collected panel on six major Japanese convenience-store chains from 47 geographical markets between 1991 and 2007. Using an instrumental variable approach to address the potential endogeneity of entry order, I find first entrants have a positive market-share advantage over later entrants. Specifically, the physical distribution, measured by the number of outlets in a market, drives most of the advantage. Meanwhile, the positive effect on sales performance for the first chain brand becomes nonexistent when I control for the outlet density. This paper further finds that the density of own outlets is nonmonotonically (inverted U) related to sales performance per outlet, suggesting dynamic outlet expansion faces a trade-off between the business-stealing effect in a chain ('cannibalization') and the advertising effect through repetition.

These studies purport to demonstrate the presence of a systematic direct relationship between order of entry for products, brands, or businesses and market share. However, an objective assessment of the literature suggests that this view must be qualified. A broadened perspective is presented that highlights the complexity of this phenomenon and suggests that first-mover status may or may not produce sustainable advantages because of a multiplicity of controllable and uncontrollable forces. A conceptual framework identifying factors that underlie first-mover advantage and product-market contingencies that moderate the order of entry-competitive advantage relationship is proffered. Several research propositions relevant for marketing theory and practice are presented.",FT50,Y

Strategic barriers conferring singularity (i.e. one-time benefit) are considered to be the most effective preservers of first-mover advantage. The theoretical model is tested empirically in a study of six major industries. Benefits operationalized as industry share and profit share were found to decline consistently with industry age according to an exponential function designated the opportunity curve.,FT50,Y
Investor flows and fragility in corporate bond funds.,"Goldstein, Itay; Jiang, Hao; Ng, David T.",Journal of Financial Economics,0304405X,,Dec2017,126,3,592,22,126392222,10.1016/j.jfineco.2016.11.007,Elsevier B.V.,Article,Capitalists & financiers; Corporate bonds; Bond funds; Financial performance; Open-End Investment Funds; Sensitivity analysis,Financial fragility; G01; G20; G23; Payoff complementarities,"This paper explores flow patterns in corporate bond mutual funds. We show that corporate bond funds exhibit a concave flow-to-performance relationship: their outflows are sensitive to bad performance more than their inflows are sensitive to good performance. Moreover, corporate bond funds tend to have greater sensitivity of outflows to bad performance when they have more illiquid assets and when the overall market illiquidity is high. These results point to the possibility of fragility in the fast-growing corporate bond market. The illiquidity of corporate bonds may generate a first-mover advantage among investors in corporate bond funds, amplifying their response to bad performance.",FT50,Y
Is there a first mover advantage in science?

Combining bibliometric (publications, citations, co-authorship) with survey data on 495 nanotechnology researchers, we analyzed career attributes, professional context and production overtime. Our econometric estimates highlight two main results. First, pioneering behavior is not exogenous: it is more probable among scientists who are already established in their “mother-discipline” (before entering nanotechnology), have a strong collaboration network, and have easy access to field-specific resources. Second, even after controlling for the endogeneity of entry timing, we find a strong first mover advantage: pioneers in the emerging field exhibit significantly higher scientific production in that field in the long run.",FT50,Y

Meta-Analysis of the Impact of Research Methods on Findings of First-Mover Advantage.,"VanderWerf, Pieter A.; Mahon, John F.",Management Science,00251909,,Nov97,43,11,1510,10,9712022383,,INFORMS: Institute for Operations Research,Article,Market entry; Competitive advantage in business; Business planning; Industrial laws & legislation; Market share; Financial performance; Break-even analysis; Success in business; Meta-analysis,First-Mover Advantage; Market Pioneer,"A long-standing hypothesis is that firms that enter a market early (""first movers"") tend to have higher performance than their followers (""first-mover advantage""). Recently, researchers have begun to argue that the statistical tests that support this relationship are limited in their applicability. That is, it is suggested that because of the methods used, these tests show the relationship only for certain subsets of firms, markets, and types of performance. We performed a meta-analysis to determine whether the findings are in fact sensitive to the methods used. We discovered that tests using market share as their performance measure were sharply and significantly more likely to find a first-mover advantage than tests using other measures (such as profitability or survival). Also significantly more likely to find an advantage were tests that sample from individually selected industries and those that include no measures of the entrants' competitive strength. Conversely, we found little evidence that ""survivor bias"" (the exclusion of nonsurviving entrants from the sample) affects a test's findings. The data further suggest that tests that use none of the questioned research practices will find a first-mover advantage no more often than can be accounted for by random statistical error alone.",FT50,Y

Payoffs are continuous and single-peaked functions of the stopping time and stopping quantile. We show that if payoffs are hump-shaped in the quantile, then a sudden 'rush' of players stops in any Nash or subgame perfect equilibrium. Fear relaxes the first mover advantage in pre-emption games, asking that the least quantile beat the average; greed relaxes the last mover advantage in wars of attrition, asking just that the last quantile payoff exceed the average. With greed, play is inefficiently late: an accelerating war of attrition starting at optimal time, followed by a rush. With fear, play is inefficiently early: a slowing pre-emption game, ending at the optimal time, preceded by a rush. The theory predicts the length, duration, and intensity of stopping, and the size and timing of rushes, and offers insights for many common timing games.",FT50,Y

Competitive Behavior-Based Price Discrimination for Software Upgrades.,"Mehra, Amit; Bala, Ram; Sankaranarayanan, Ramesh",Information Systems Research,10477047,,Mar2012,23,1,60,15,76359378,10.1287/isre.1100.0291,INFORMS: Institute for Operations Research,Article,"Computer software development; Price discrimination; Computer software industry; New product development; Market prices; Custom Computer Programming Services; Computer systems design and related services (except video game design and development); Software publishers (except video game publishers); Software Publishers; Computer and software stores; Computer, computer peripheral and pre-packaged software merchant wholesalers; Computer and Computer Peripheral Equipment and Software Merchant Wholesalers; Marketing Consulting Services; Competition",behavior-based pricing; competitive strategy; forward-looking customers; software upgrades; switching costs,"The introduction of product upgrades in a competitive environment is commonly observed in the software industry. When introducing a new product, a software vendor may employ behavior-based price discrimination (BBPD) by offering a discount over its market price to entice existing customers of the competitor. This type of pricing is referred to as competitive upgrade discount pricing and is possible because the vendor can use proof of purchase of a competitor's product as credible evidence to offer the discount. At the same time, the competitor may offer a discount to its own previous customers in order to induce them to buy its upgrade. We formulate a game-theoretic model involving an incumbent and entrant where both firms can offer discounts to existing customers of the incumbent. Although several equilibrium possibilities exist, we establish that an equilibrium with competitive upgrade discount pricing is observed only for a unique market structure and a corresponding unique set of prices. In this equilibrium, instead of leveraging its first mover advantage, the incumbent cedes market share to the entrant. Furthermore, the profits of both the incumbent and the entrant reduce with switching costs. This implies that the use of BBPD has product design implications because firms may influence the switching costs between their products by making appropriate compatibility decisions. In addition, lower switching costs result in reduced consumer surplus. Hence, a social planner may want to increase switching costs. The resulting policy implications are different from those prevalent in other industries such as mobile telecommunications where the regulators reduced switching costs by enforcing number portability.",FT50,Y

We test our hypotheses in the context of the European mobile telecommunications industry. This is a sector that has been characterized by high rates of growth in the number of subscribers, which could reduce the effectiveness of switching costs from being effective as an isolating mechanism.

Pricing Games and Impact of Private Demand Information in Decentralized Assembly Systems.,"Kalkancı, Başak; Erhun, Feryal",Operations Research,0030364X,,Sep/Oct2012,60,5,1142,15,83362428,,INFORMS: Institute for Operations Research,Article,Contracts; Profit -- Mathematical models; Suppliers; Economic equilibrium; Demand (Economic theory); Sequences (Mathematics),,"This paper analyzes decentralized assembly systems under asymmetric demand information and sequential contracting. We reveal new insights on the value of contract type (price-only versus complex), demand information (complete versus asymmetric), and contract sequence (first mover versus second mover) to different players. Our results for the basic model show the following: (1) Complex contracts increase the suppliers' aggregate profit; however, individual suppliers do not necessarily benefit from a complex contracting equilibrium. We identify the conditions under which each supplier benefits from such an equilibrium. (2) Eliminating information asymmetry is not always beneficial for the suppliers because obtaining information might bring only marginal value and hence might not be realistically justified. Furthermore, a downstream supplier might prefer information asymmetry to complete information, especially when demand variability is moderate. (3) Unless there is a high demand risk, the first-mover advantage is prevalent when the assembler is a price-taker. We extend our basic model to analyze two additional scenarios. First, we study cases where the suppliers may offer contracts of different complexity. Beyond enriching our understanding of contract choice in decentralized assembly systems, such variations enhance the analysis beyond the standard methodology of principal-agent models and utilize solution techniques from optimal control. Second, we analyze the situation where the suppliers may possess different levels of information on demand under complex contracts. We show that an upstream supplier always benefits from a downstream supplier's superior information. However, the additional information might decrease the downstream supplier's profit, especially when the forecast variability is low compared to the total demand variability in the system. Our results for the basic model and its extensions confirm that studying interactions between suppliers, specifically under different contract types and information structures, in assembly systems presents rich opportunities for future research.",FT50,Y

Past research has found evidence supporting both claims. To reconcile these contradictory findings, we developed and tested an integrative model-the Information-Anchoring Model of First Offers. The model predicts when and why making the first offer helps versus hurts. We suggest that first offers have 2 effects. First, they serve as anchors that pull final settlements toward the initial first-offer value; this anchor function often produces a first-mover advantage. Second, first offers can convey information on the senders' priorities, which makes the sender vulnerable to exploitation and increases the risk of a first-mover disadvantage. To test this model, 3 experiments manipulated the information that senders communicated in their first offer. When senders did not reveal their priorities, the first-mover advantage was replicated. However, when first offers revealed senders' priorities explicitly, implicitly, or both, a first-mover disadvantage emerged. Negotiators' social value orientation moderated this effect: A first-mover disadvantage occurred when senders faced proself recipients who exploited priority information, but not with prosocial recipients. Moderated mediation analyses supported the model assumptions: Proself recipients used their integrative insight to feign priorities in their low-priority issues and thereby claimed more individual value than senders. The final discussion reviews theoretical and applied implications of the Information-Anchoring Model of First Offers. (PsycINFO Database Record",FT50,N
The Supply Chain Effects of Bankruptcy.,"Yang, S.

Bankruptcy; Organizational behavior research,bankruptcy; operational competitiveness; operations-finance interface; supply chain interaction,"This paper examines how a firm's financial distress and the legal environment regarding the ease of bankruptcy reorganization can alter product market competition and supplier-buyer relationships. We identify three effects--predation, bail-out, and abetment--that can change firms' behavior from their actions in the absence of financial distress. The predation effect increases competition before potential bankruptcy as the nondistressed competitor behaves as if it has some first-mover advantage that could benefit a supplier with price control. The bail-out effect reflects the supplier's incentive to grant the distressed firm concessions to preserve competition, improving supply chain efficiency and providing support for the exclusivity rule in Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code when the supplier and the distressed firm are financially linked. The abetment effect is that the supplier may deliberately abet the competitor's predation, leading to increased operational disadvantages for the distressed firm before bankruptcy.

Adoption of Information Technology Under Network Effects.,"Deishin Lee; Mendelson, Haim",Information Systems Research,10477047,,Dec2007,18,4,395,19,28652953,,INFORMS: Institute for Operations Research,Article,Information technology; Information & communication technologies; Network effect; Value (Economics); Computer networks; Information networks; Computer Systems Design Services,adoption; compatibility; first mover; information technology; network effects; standards,"Because information technologies are often characterized by network effects, compatibility is an important issue. Although total network value is maximized when everyone operates in one compatible network, we find that the technology benefits for the users depend on vendor incentives, which are driven by the existence of ""de facto"" or ""de jure"" standards. In head-to-head competition, customers are better off ""letting a thousand flowers bloom,"" fostering fierce competition that results in a de facto standard if users prefer compatibility over individual fit, or a split market if fit is more important. In contrast, firms that sponsor these products are better off establishing an up-front, de jure standard to lessen the competitive effects of a network market. However, if a firm is able to enter the market first by choosing a proprietary/incompatible technology, it can use a ""divide-and-conquer"" strategy to increase its profit compared with head-to-head competition, even when there are no switching costs. When there is a first mover, the early adopters, who are ""locked in"" because of switching costs, never regret their decision to adopt, whereas the late adopters, who are not subject to switching costs, are exploited by the incumbent firm. In head-to-head competition, customers are unified in their preference for incompatibility when there is a first mover; late adopters prefer de jure compatibility because they bear the brunt of the first-mover advantage. This again underscores the interdependence of user net benefits and vendor strategies.",FT50,Y
Cross-Market Network Effect with Asymmetric Customer Loyalty: Implications for Competitive Advantage.,Yuxin Chen; Jinhong Xie,Marketing Science,07322399,,Jan/Feb2007,26,1,52,15,24496391,,INFORMS: Institute for Operations Research,Article,Customer loyalty; Competitive advantage in business; Newspaper publishing; Markets; Market share; Profit; Newspaper Publishers,competitive advantage; cross-market network effect; customer loyalty; first-mover advantage; newspaper industry; two-sided markets,"Across-market network effect exists in many industries (e.g., newspaper publishing, media, software) in which a seller sells both a primary and a secondary product (e.g., a newspaper publisher sells newspapers to readers and advertising space to advertisers), and the value of the secondary product depends on the size of the user base of the primary product. This paper examines the competitive implications of asymmetric customer loyalty in such markets. In traditional markets, an advantage in customer loyalty generates a profit advantage. We show here, however, that in the presence of a cross-market network effect, a midlevel of loyalty advantage in the primary product market can lead to an overall profit disadvantage. This surprising result is derived from the interdependence of the two markets, whereby a profit in one market may be gained at the cost of the other, and by the positive relationship between a larger loyalty segment and a higher opportunity cost of price competition in the product of the primary market. Extending our model to a two-period entry game also shows that under certain conditions, the entrant with disadvantage in customer loyalty can outperform the incumbent in profit and market share. This result suggests that asymmetry in customer loyalty can be a source of ""first-mover"" advantage or disadvantage.",FT50,Y

The technique allows one to augment market share data with information relating consumer demographics to the characteristics of the products they purchase. This extra information plays the same role as consumer-level data, allowing estimated substitution patterns and (thus) welfare to directly reflect demographic-driven differences in tastes for observed characteristics. I apply the technique to the automobile market, estimating the economic effects of the introduction of the minivan. I show that models estimated without micro data yield much larger welfare numbers than the model using them, primarily because the micro data appear to free the model from a heavy dependence on the idiosyncratic logit “taste” error. I complete the welfare picture by measuring the extent of first-mover advantage and profit cannibalization both initially by the innovator and later by the imitators. My results support a story in which large improvements in consumers' standard of living arise from competition as firms cannibalize each other's profits by seeking new goods that give them some temporary market power.",FT50,Y

It is true that Reinganum's model includes uncertainty, and in her model an incumbent would not preempt competitors but uncertainty is not the reason why her results differ from authors'. Rather, the differences are the consequence of 1) a different assumption about timing of moves in the R&D game, 2) the absence of free entry, and 3) assumed diseconomies in the management of the firm. Although it is useful to call attention to the importance of these assumptions, it is equally important to understand why they lead to different conclusions. In their 1982 article, authors assumed that the incumbent had a first-mover advantage, and that he could credibly commit himself to a strategy that would make entry unprofitable. Potential entrants, observing this already chosen and committed strategy, would then choose to stay out, whether or not the subsequent race was deterministic or stochastic. In Reinganum's model, the entrant and the incumbent simultaneously choose their expenditure rates, and the incumbent has no first-mover advantage.",FT50,Y

This creates a first-mover advantage to software developers. The paper studies whether the benefits of declining development costs are passed on to buyers in the form of lower prices when developers bid strategically. By using a model of bidding auctions we characterize equilibrium bidding strategies of two software developers. In order to become the first mover and attain future market dominance, developers find it optimal to forgo profits from the first projects. As a result, bid prices ( = development cost plus a profit margin to the developer) to the first buyers may not necessarily decrease over time, and even if so, not as fast as development cost drops. We also show that bidders expect a higher profit margin from a high-variance project. Thus, if there exist high-variance projects in the future, developers are more likely to submit below-cost bid prices or ""low-ball.""",FT50,Y
NETWORK STRUCTURE EFFECTS ON INCUMBENCY ADVANTAGE.,JEHO LEE; JAEYONG SONG; JAE-SUK YANG,Strategic Management Journal,01432095,,Aug2016,37,8,1632,17,117243027,10.1002/smj.2405,Wiley-Blackwell,Article,Network effect; Organizational structure; Social networks; First-mover advantage; Decision making; Consumers; Other Individual and Family Services; Social distance,advantage; entry; network; small world; technology,"Research summary: The literature on network effects has implicitly assumed that an increase in the size of the installed base magnifies network effects, which is a source of incumbency advantage. We argue that the overemphasis on this relationship has resulted in controversy and confusion in the literature, where the role of social networks remains largely unaddressed. By developing computational models of network effects with various network structures, we show that social distance in a customer network plays a moderating role that strengthens or weakens the relationship between the installed base and network effects, which in turn, affects the durability of incumbency advantage. When the average social distance between members in a customer network is large, the incumbency advantage will not be amplified, and an entrant with an incompatible product or service may find ways into the market. On the other hand, when the average social distance is small, early entry with a growing installed base will magnify incumbency advantage. Managerial summary: In evaluating the strength of incumbency advantage or determining the price of an early mover, the size of the installed base has been widely used. We find that it is not a sufficient statistic, and confusion and error appear to result from assuming that it is. Our study suggests that degrees of separation, a measure of social distance in a network, can provide managers with an additional yardstick to sharpen their evaluation. When customer networks are characterized by fewer degrees of separation, the conventional use of the installed base as a metric may be reasonable. On the other hand, when customer networks are characterized by larger degrees of separation, the conventional use may potentially mislead managers in their decision-making. Thinking about the roots of user benefits (e.g., access to a few significant others vs. hubs) may be a reasonable starting point for assessing degrees of separation in a customer network.",FT50,Y
PRODUCT AND PRICE COMPETITION IN A DUOPOLY.,"Moorthy, K.

In the model studied here, there are two identical firms competing on product quality and price. They face consumers who prefer a higher quality product to a lower quality product, but differ in how much they are willing to pay for quality. The consumers can also choose a substitute if they don't like the product-price offerings of the two firms. For the firms, a higher quality product costs more to produce than a lower quality product. The paper shows that the equilibrium strategy for each firm should be to differentiate its product from its competitor, with the firm choosing the higher quality choosing the higher margin as well. This differentiation, however, is not efficient--that is, it is possible to choose two other products and offer them at prices that cover their marginal cost, and still satisfy consumers' ""needs"" better in the aggregate. A monopolist, by contrast, would differentiate his product line efficiently. This suggests that cannibalization has different effects on product strategy than competition. The paper also shows that if one firm enters the market first, then it can defend itself from later entrants, and gain a first-mover advantage, by preempting the most desirable product position.",FT50,Y
Profits and the Internet: Seven Misconceptions.,"Rangan, Subramanian; Adner, Ron",MIT Sloan Management Review,15329194,,Summer2001,42,4,44,10,4834377,,Sloan Management Review,Article,Internet; Business planning; Success in business; Electronic commerce; Industrial management; Wired Telecommunications Carriers; Internet Publishing and Broadcasting and Web Search Portals; Electronic shopping and mail-order houses; Electronic Shopping,,"The Internet has created new markets, customers, products and modes of conducting business. But it also has given currency to some dangerous half-truths. Admonishing Internet businesses to ""stop grabbing the land and start cultivating it,"" Subramanian Rangan and Ron Adner, professors of management and strategy at INSEAD in France, explain why seven popular strategies are not the path to profitable growth. First-mover advantage, for example, gets too much credit for e-business success. Companies believe that they can lock in customers and trigger a winner-take-all dynamic, but there is no guarantee that those benefits will go to first movers. The allure of reach -- increasing the number of customer segments -- causes many companies to ignore fit, the coherence with which their activities reinforce one another. Digital Equipment Corp. paid the price when it sacrificed fit to reach, attempting to make PCs, workstations, minicomputers and mainframes under one roof. Another tempting growth strategy is to provide customer solutions, offering products or services that complement a company's core offering. But offering solutions can dilute a company's focus. Targeting the right Internet sector is one way to maintain focus. When companies view the Internet as undifferentiated landscape, they are less able to distinguish the drivers of customer value and performance -- or the metrics to measure them. Some companies see best-of-breed-partner leverage as the secret of profitable growth. But although the Internet makes it easier and cheaper to align activities across company boundaries, it does not do much to align interests -- a requirement for the creation of joint value. Another misconception is the belief that an Internet business will automatically be successful abroad. As MTV, Wal-Mart and Honda discovered, companies first must be successful at home and then move outward in a way that accommodates local differences. The last, and perhaps most dangerous, misconception is managers' belief that technology can substitute for strategy. Technology and strategy are strong complements. Companies that understand their technology better than they understand their customers and competition won't succeed in any economy, old or new. The authors provide thoughtful guidelines for avoiding misconceptions and taking a sensible approach to business on the Internet.",FT50,Y

This paper considers the basis for those concerns in the framework of' a duopoly in which one privately informed producer enters the forward market prior to production. In choosing its forward position, the firm considers the effects of that position on the forward price and second stage product market competition with its rival. Two regimes are considered: mandated disclosure and no disclosure. Under the former, the contracting firm faces a tension between exploiting its information advantage in the forward market and attempting to influence the production decision of its rival. On average, in equilibrium, the contracting firm gains a first-mover advantage, but at the cost of revealing its private information to its rival and extracting less expected gains from uninformed forward market participants. In contrast, with no disclosure, the contracting firm cannot influence rival firm beliefs, but extracts more expected gains from its private information in both the forward and product markets. On balance, the contracting firm prefers no disclosure. Moreover, parameterizations exist such that the rival also prefers that regime. These findings explain the opposition of respondents to draft proposals of Statement of' Financial Standards No. 133.",FT50,Y

Building on these previous studies, we here test the hypothesis that the technological and market strategies of a new entrant are highly interrelated and that their joint effect plays an important role in a firm's probability of survival. In particular, we propose that firms that target new market segments with an architectural innovation will tend to be more successful than those that target existing markets or innovate in component technology, even after controlling for all the competing predictors of survival. This paper advances the existing literature on innovation by tracing the main technical elements of a dominant design in the rigid disk drive industry over time, and provides a much more rigorous definition of the concept of a dominant design than we have had in the past. We find the notion of first-mover advantage is not applicable in the rigid disk drive industry. Instead, we propose the idea of an entry-window tightly linked to the emergence of the dominant product design as defined.",FT50,Y

In sharp contrast to these findings, we find that at the business unit level being first-to-market leads, on average, to a long-term profit disadvantage. This result holds for a sample of consumer goods as well as a sample of industrial goods and leads to questions about the validity of first mover advantage, in and of itself, as a strategy to achieve superior performance. We replicate the typical demand-side pioneering advantage but find an even greater average cost disadvantage, which is the source of the pioneering profit disadvantage. In an extended analysis, we show that first-to-market leads to an initial profit advantage, which, depending on the sample or profit measure, lasts for about 12 to 14 years before turning into a disadvantage. Moreover, we show that pioneers differentially benefit from a lack of consumer learning, a strong market position and patent protection. These three moderating factors together can actually help pioneers achieve a sustainable profit advantage over later entrants. Finally, we find strong support for the theoretical argument that the entry order decision should be treated as endogenous in empirical estimation.",FT50,Y

The data contain information on supplier interactions with retail stores, including Wal-Mart, for a period of five years. They find that postentry supplier profits increased by 18%% on average, whereas profits derived from incumbent retailers decreased only marginally. Their results show that wholesale prices are not the main driver of postentry supplier profit changes; market expansion is. They observe a significant increase in shipments to 50%% of markets studied. Furthermore, their analyses demonstrate that supplier shipment and profit increases are highest for markets in which incumbents offer a wide variety of products and carry items that Wal-Mart does not sell.",FT50,Y

In this study, we empirically examine the entry timing implications of firms' intrinsic speed capabilities, which refer to the ability to execute investment projects faster than competitors. We hypothesize that firms with intrinsic speed capabilities face low preemption risks and, thus, can afford to wait longer for uncertainty resolution before deciding to enter new markets. This hypothesis is more applicable when investment is associated with higher levels of commitment and, thus, greater option value of waiting. A direct implication is that late entrants with intrinsic speed capabilities should have greater expected post-entry performance. We find support for these hypotheses in the Atlantic Basin liquefied natural gas ( LNG) industry from 1996 to 2007. Copyright © 2013 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",FT50,Y

For these industrial goods businesses, 66% of the pioneers versus 48% of the early followers survived at least ten years. The main conclusion is that the pioneer's temporary monopoly over the early followers plus its first-mover advantages typically offset the survival risks associated with market and technological uncertainties. These results are consistent with previous research in the sense that first-mover advantages that increase a pioneer's market share also help protect the pioneer from outright failure.",FT50,Y

We show in this study that even if other benefits do not exist, a software firm can still benefit from giving away fully functioning software. This is due to the accelerated diffusion process and subsequently the increased net present value of future sales. By adapting the Bass diffusion model to capture the impact of free software offer, we provide a methodology to determine the optimal number of free adopters. We show that the optimal free offer solution depends on the discount rate, the length of the demand window, and the ratio of low-valuation to high-valuation free adopters.

Survival in Markets with Network Effects: Product Compatibility and Order-of-Entry Effects.,"Wang, Qi; Chen, Yubo; Xie, Jinhong",Journal of Marketing,00222429,,Jul2010,74,4,1,14,51168743,10.1509/jmkg.74.4.1,American Marketing Association,Article,Network effect; Follower advantage; Consumer goods; Competitive advantage in business; First-mover advantage; New product development; Value (Economics); Commercial products; Market entry; Market pricing; Marketing strategy; Product launches; Commodity Contracts Brokerage; Commodity Contracts Dealing; All Other Consumer Goods Rental; Marketing Consulting Services,network effects; order-of-entry effects; product compatibility; survival analysis,"This article proposes a new conceptual framework in which the impact of network effects (NE) on a pioneer's survival advantage compared with its early followers can be positive or negative depending on two important but previously ignored market characteristics: (1) cross-generation product compatibility and (2) within-generation product compatibility. The authors empirically test the theoretical predictions using data from 45 NE markets. They show that these two types of compatibility affect the pioneer's survival advantage in opposite directions and that such directions are reversed when NE changes from extremely strong to extremely weak. Specifically, in markets with strong NE, cross-generation incompatibility harms but within-generation incompatibility favors the pioneer's survival advantage. Consequently, pioneers are likely to enjoy a survival advantage when their product is cross-generation compatible but within-generation incompatible. However, in markets with weak NE, pioneer survival advantage is likely to occur under opposite conditions (i.e., cross-generation incompatible but within-generation compatible). The policy analysis further suggests that the best survival condition for pioneers often turns out to be the worst for followers in these markets.",FT50,Y

That fact is not fully recognized by traditional demographic and psychographic techniques, and the labels that consumers use to define who they are do not necessarily correspond to the variables that marketers typically rely on. A new approach -- identity marketing -- better captures the complex process of how people's sense of who they are influences their purchase decisions. To be sure, the complexity of identity-based judgments presents both opportunities and obstacles for marketers, but companies often fail to appreciate this. In fact, many marketing blunders can be traced back to a fundamental misunderstanding of customer identity. Common mistakes include the following: (1) selling new products solely on their features, (2) failing to solidify first-mover advantage, (3) fighting the competition head-on, (4) sticking with what's worked before, (5) underestimating low-involvement products, and (6) attacking negative word-of-mouth. Identity marketing helps companies avoid such mistakes by providing a deeper understanding of how customers become strongly attracted to the brands and products that are linked to their multiple -- and sometimes seemingly contradictory -- identities.",FT50,Y

The authors establish that when the incumbent is more aggressive in research and development (R&D), this negatively affects the entrant's marginal return on R&D. Thus, if greater profits produce a strong (weak) desire for the incumbent to increase its R&D level, the entrant will respond by sharply decreasing (increasing) its R&D level. As a result, the incumbent's likelihood of retaining the lead position will exhibit an inverse U-shaped pattern as a function of monopoly and duopoly profits. The authors then examine the impact of uncertainty about the rewards from new products and allow firms to conduct market research to resolve the uncertainty. They characterize the conditions for the entrant's innovation versus imitation decision to reveal information about future rewards to the incumbent. When duopoly profits are uncertain and can be either high (upside potential) or low (downside potential), the entry strategy will be revealing if the upside potential is attractive enough relative to monopoly profits. In contrast, when innovation has uncertain commercial potential (i.e., either valued or not valued by consumers), the entry strategy will be revealing if duopoly profits are unattractive relative to monopoly profits. In these cases, the entrant's innovation–imitation decision is driven by market research; this allows the incumbent to forgo market research and infer the true state of demand from the type of entry strategy it observes.",FT50,Y

The authors systematically examine the leads and lags at critical stages of the product development process: concept generation, prototype completion, and volume production. Their main finding is that lead-time advantage affects market share positively, albeit differentially, at each stage. The benefit of lead-time gain is greatest at the volume production stage, followed by the concept generation stage. The authors also develop a new notion of lead-time threshold-a time period in which if a competitor catches up, no market share gain is achieved by the firm that introduces the product first. They endogenously estimate the magnitude of the threshold for each stage of the product development process, observing that a significant threshold is present at both the concept generation and volume production stages. Finally, the structure of the development process, which differs across the firms in the market, affords significant differential ability to catch up with competitors.",FT50,Y

In this article, the strategic impacts of IT investment are studied through the development of a formal economic model. In particular, it focuses on IT-related quality competition in a duopoly, where the services may not be priced initially (e.g., in the financial services sector), and where the benefits may come indirectly (e.g., in the form of interest earned on consumer deposits or float on checking accounts). A firm may have to invest in IT, regardless of its underlying cost structure, as a response to its competitor's investment level. (We analyze the division of technology benefits between the firms and the consumers and study welfare implications for simultaneous and sequential investments.) Both firms prefer sequential over simultaneous investments, even when both have the required technology. While the IT-inefficient firm (one with higher IT cost for a given service quality) has followership incentives, the leadership incentives for the IT-efficient firm depend on the difference in IT cost structures and on the degree of substitutability between the services of the two firms. A preliminary treatment of pricing issues is provided in conjunction with consumer switching cost, which not only has a negative impact on consumer welfare but may also reduce total industry profits. For dynamic markets with new consumers, the negative effect of switching cost on the welfare of existing consumers is reduced when the IT-efficient firm moves first.",FT50,Y

We disentangle these sources by breaking total cost of a business unit into three different components--purchasing, production, and selling, general, and administrative (SG&A) costs--and identifying conditions that intensify or reduce the effect of the proposed source. Using two samples of business units, one for consumer goods and one for industrial goods, we find support for five of the six sources of pioneering cost advantage and disadvantage in both samples, while the advantage due to preemption of ideal market space is limited to the consumer goods sample. The unconditional analysis shows a pioneering purchasing cost advantage but even larger pioneering production and SG&A cost disadvantages.

These changes in product development leaders happen frequently, e.g., 76% of firms that were first to commercialize an innovation failed to launch it in the broader market.

To test these hypotheses, the author formulates models of introduction and response strategies, including an anticipated incumbent reaction formation model. The results of the empirical analysis show that new product introduction strategy is influenced significantly by incumbent reaction strategy, and vice versa. The relationship of a new product's marketing spending to the anticipated incumbent reaction is different for incumbents of different sizes. The analysis shows that higher spending by a new brand results in incumbent response that is significantly lower in magnitude.

Whether such a strategy leads to a pioneering profit advantage relative to followers also depends on its cost effects. In this paper, we examine when the market share advantage of a pioneering firm with a broad product line strategy translates into a profit advantage by examining the cost effects of this strategy. Using the profit impact of marketing strategies data and an estimation method that controls for various unobserved factors, we find significant differences between different industry settings. From these contrasting findings, we generate an emerging theoretical framework that we subject to empirical testing. We conjecture, and empirically verify, that creating a broad product line with a versioning strategy--creating variety from a standard product in anticipating customer demand--does not increase the pioneering cost disadvantage, and thus results in a pioneering profit advantage. On the other hand, with a tailoring strategy--creating variety by customizing a product to actual customer demand--a broad product line substantially increases the pioneering cost disadvantage, thereby making a preemption strategy counterproductive.",FT50,Y

The authors estimate the model using data on 29 brands from six pharmaceutical markets. The results reveal advantages associated with entering during the growth stage. Growth-stage entrants reach their asymptotic sales level faster than pioneers or mature-stage entrants, are not hurt by competitor diffusion, and enjoy a higher response to perceived product quality than pioneers and mature-stage entrants. Pioneers reach their asymptotic sales levels more slowly than later entrants, and pioneer's sales, unlike later entrants' sales, are hurt by competitor diffusion over time. On the positive side for pioneers, buyers are most responsive to marketing spending by pioneers. Mature-stage entrants are most disadvantaged; they grow more slowly than growth-stage entrants, have lower response to product quality than growth-stage entrants, and have the lowest response to marketing spending.",FT50,Y

The authors extend this literature by developing a framework that proposes a contingency approach to the value of organizational capabilities. This framework highlights the effect of information in the external environment in stimulating firms to deploy their technology and marketing capabilities to influence the level and speed of relevant product development activities. Using a longitudinal quasiexperiment to isolate the effects of external information on the relationship between firm capabilities and product development outcomes, the authors obtain results that are consistent with this framework. The authors therefore conclude that the most valuable characteristic of firm capabilities may be their ability to serve as flexible strategic options. In this role, firms can deploy them in ways consistent with environmental forces.",FT50,Y
The dynamic nature of survival determinants in e-commerce.,"Nikolaeva, Ralitza",Journal of the Academy of Marketing Science,00920703,,Winter2007,35,4,560,12,28137157,,Springer Science & Business Media B.V.,Article,Electronic commerce; Business enterprises; Internet sales; First-mover advantage; Publicity; Electronic shopping and mail-order houses; Electronic Shopping; Competition,,"Abstract The dynamic effects of survival determinants in e-commerce are tested using longitudinal data on 460 e-tailers. This is achieved through the incorporation of both time-varying covariates and coefficients in a discrete hazard rate model. The model includes elements of competitive strategy, industry structure, firm and product characteristics, and the macro environment. The study demonstrates the changing effect over time of factors affecting survival. For example, order of entry advantages are observed, but they are short-lived. This finding shows that e-tailers cannot rely on early entry as a strategic move in the long run. E-tailers with more media presence seem to survive longer. Being publicly traded and selling products with digital characteristics present advantages for e-tailers only in the beginning years, but they are not sustainable over long time periods. Survival chances decrease with higher competitive density, market growth rate, and equity market level at the time of entry. Conversely, economic growth tends to increase survival chances. The study also finds an inverted-U relationship between the hazard of exit and firm age. The conclusion section discusses the implications of the time- varying nature of survival determinants.",FT50,Y

In such new categories, market shares are strongly affected by retailer distribution decisions. Because a retailer that considers a brand for distribution can take into account the prior performance of that brand with other retailers, the success of a manufacturer in obtaining distribution can depend positively on its brand's market share to date. This creates positive feedback between a brand's market share and its distribution over the growth stage of the category. Temporary positive feedback, along with the way manufacturers influence their brand's market share and distribution, is hypothesized to drive the emergence of the market structure. The authors model this feedback to quantify the evolution of a brand's coupled market share and distribution. Empirical results using data from the U.S. ready-to-drink tea category suggest that positive feedback between market share and distribution exists in the early growth stage of the category. Therefore, early in the life of the new category small short-term changes in market share or distribution may generate larger long-term changes in market share and distribution. Later, such momentum appears absent. In this context, the authors discuss how a late entrant fails to capture a sizeable share of the market.",FT50,Y

One is a quantity competition model, and the other is a price competition model with product differentiation. The key factor is the existence of two heterogeneous consumer groups: those who demand only high-end (name-brand) products and those who care little whether products are high or low end. We show that, under certain conditions, the profits of firms in the high-end market are larger when there are firms producing low-end products than when there are not. The existence of price-sensitive consumers who care little about product quality intensifies competition among the high-end firms. The existence of low-end firms functions as a credible threat, which induces the high-end firms not to overproduce because price-sensitive consumers buy products from the low-end firms. The result provides a new theoretical mechanism concerning the profitability and pricing of national brand firms after the entry of private labels. It has an implication for pricing and marketing strategies: Established firms should not decrease their prices after the entry of nonestablished firms.",FT50,Y

Whereas Yahoo was the early market leader, there has been entry by both lower-quality engines and higher-quality ones (such as Google). Prior work on quality differentiation requires that low-quality products have low prices in order to survive in a market with high-quality products. However, the price charged to users of search engines is typically zero. Therefore, consumers do not face a tradeoff between quality and price. Why do lower-quality products survive in such a market? We develop a vertical differentiation model that explains this phenomenon. The quality of the results provided by a search engine is inherently stochastic, and there is no charge for using an engine. Therefore, users who try out one engine may consult a lower-quality engine in the same session. This ""residual demand"" allows lower-quality products to survive in equilibrium. We then extend our model to incorporate horizontal differentiation as well and show that residual demand leads to higher quality and less differentiation in this market. Engines want to attract competitors' customers and therefore have a strong incentive to be ""similar"" to each other.",FT50,Y

A key competitive dynamics question for many organizations is how to build a competitive advantage in turbulence with digital IT systems. The literature has focused mostly on developing and exercising dynamic capabilities for planned reconfiguration of existing operational capabilities in fairly stable environments with patterned ""waves,"" but this may not always be possible, or even appropriate, in highly turbulent environments with unexpected ""storms."" We introduce improvisational capabilities as an alternative means for managing highly turbulent environments; we define this as the ability to spontaneously reconfigure existing resources to build new operational capabilities to address urgent, unpredictable, and novel environmental situations. In contrast to the planned role of dynamic and operational capabilities and the ambidexterity that they jointly offer, improvisational capabilities are proposed to operate distinctly as a ""third hand"" that facilitates reconfiguration and change in highly turbulent environments. First, the paper develops the notion of improvisational capabilities and articulates the key differences between the two ""reconfiguration""—improvisational and dynamic—capabilities. Second, the paper compares the relative effects of improvisational and dynamic capabilities in the context of new product development in different levels of environmental turbulence. Third, the paper shows how IT-leveraging capability in new product development is decomposed into its three digital IT systems: project and resource management systems, organizational memory systems (OMS), and cooperative work systems—and how each of these IT systems enhances improvisational capabilities, an effect that is accentuated in highly turbulent environments. The results show that although dynamic capabilities are the primary predictor of competitive advantage in moderately turbulent environments, improvisational capabilities fully dominate in highly turbulent environments. Besides discriminant validity, the distinction between improvisational and dynamic capabilities is evidenced by the differential effects of IT-leveraging capability on improvisational and dynamic capabilities. The results show that the more the IT-leveraging capability is catered toward managing resources (through project and resource management systems) and team collaboration (through cooperative work systems) rather than relying on past knowledge and procedures (through organizational memory systems), the more it is positively associated with improvisational capabilities, particularly in more turbulent environments. The paper draws implications for how different IT systems can influence improvisational capabilities and competitive advantage in turbulent environments, thereby enhancing our understanding of the role of IT systems on reconfiguration capabilities. The paper discusses the theoretical and practical implications of building and exercising the ""third hand"" of improvisational capabilities for IT-enabled competitive dynamics in turbulence.",FT50,Y

(2) What should its performance level be? and (3) How do the decisions of a competing firm affect a firm's timing and product performance decisions? The authors present a detailed case study of the initial competitors in the personal digital assistant (PDA) industry on the basis of which they construct a stylized game-theoretic model of entry timing and product performance level decisions in a duopoly. Situations in which the duopolists are symmetric as well as asymmetric in terms of their estimates of market size and product development capabilities are considered. When firms are symmetric, the authors show that an equilibrium exists when the firms enter at different times with different performance levels. In the asymmetric cases, the firm that has a higher estimate of market size enters first, as does the firm with a superior development process. The performance level decisions, however, depend on the sensitivity of demand to this variable. The results provide one explanation for empirical observations that market pioneers maintain their leadership in some cases, and later entrants eventually dominate in other cases. The authors then relate the model results to actual decisions in the PDA market, finding that Apple's Newton was ""too little, too early.""",FT50,Y

The paper explores the reasons why some late entrants prevailed over others and some of the mechanisms that allowed late entrants to overcome pioneers. The factors involved in survival relative to pioneers include the limited, protection of patents, complacency, the mobility of staff with expertise in a new technology (in this case cel animation), and the neglected importance of managerial and organizational factors.

It proceeds to delineate an entrepreneurship perspective on the nature and boundaries of the firm, where boundary decisions are driven by the difficulty of implementing new, subjective means–ends frameworks in sometimes very unreceptive markets. A set of propositions developing the concepts of cognitive incongruence and cognitive incompleteness suggests that activities are internalized when other market participants are unable to accept or understand the entrepreneur's subjectively perceived means–ends framework.

Past research efforts, however, have been concentrated mostly on first mover or early entrant advantages. To contribute to developing a theory of latecomer strategies, the authors investigate how late-comers compete successfully or even leapfrog early movers. They review previous studies on early mover advantages and disadvantages, and group the sources of such advantages or disadvantages into three areas: the firm, its market, and its competitors. The theoretical focus is how a firm converts the opportunities stemming from entry order into performance. The authors seek to confirm and extend relevant theories by examining how late entrants have caught up with incumbent industry leaders in the global semiconductor industry. On the basis of in-depth case analysis of three Japanese and three Korean semiconductor companies, they identify and categorize successful latecomer strategies into two types: strategies for overcoming latecomer disadvantages and strategies for utilizing latecomer advantages. Focusing, thin margin or loss bearing, and volume building form the essence of strategies for overcoming disadvantages, whereas odd timing, time compression, human-embodied technology transfer, benchmarking, technological leapfrogging, and resource leveraging form the essence of strategies for utilizing advantages. Because many companies in Asia have had to face the reality of being latecomers, the Asian perspectives are particularly useful for studying and explicating latecomer strategies.",FT50,Y

We refer to such firms as ""Entrepreneurial M-forms,"" and maintain that their reliance on an activist CEO offers benefits: (1) in turbulent environments, when the use of slow, bottom-up planning processes risks forfeiting first-mover advantages; and (2) when expansion entails major capital commitments, and division managers may be reluctant to accept the career risks associated with sponsorship of ""bet-the-company"" projects.",FT50,Y

Cross-sectional research designs are combined with the static metaphors of contingency thinking to analyse the fit between the positioning and resource base of the firm and its performance in differing environments. However, the inadequacies of this tradition are increasingly recognised even by scholars who have created it (Porter 1991). Strategy can no longer be conceived through the static language of states or positions and must now be understood as an innovation contest where the bureaucratic and inflexible will not survive. This paper takes up the challenge to explore the dynamics of industry and firm strategy development. The empirical focus of the paper is the U.K. insurance industry in a period of upheaval between 1990 and 1996. By means of an innovative crosscorrelational time series analysis, we are able to show the ebb and flow of strategic change in the industry and the patterns of initiation and imitation as certain firms lead areas of strategy and others follow. These findings are interrogated and interpreted by drawing on and developing theoretical ideas from three literatures which historically have not talked to one another. These are the literatures on innovation, institutionalism, and contextualism.The empirical results show firms pursuing multiple strategies at one point in time and also altering the strategic agenda over time. A cross-correlational analysis of nine firms in the U.K. insurance industry reveals the existence of leaders and laggards in the development of a variety of strategic initiatives. Theoretically the paper examines the mixture of external conditions and internal context and processes which contribute to the development of early and later adopters of strategies in an industry over time.",FT50,Y

Faced with developing countries' limited and inadequately enforced patent and copyright laws, some companies are resorting to market-based strategies to protect their intellectual property. These include preempting or threatening competitors, embedding intellectual property in environments that can be protected, bundling insecure intellectual property with its more secure cousins, and actually entering the businesses that pose a threat. The authors urge companies coping with weak property rights to follow a decision tree when choosing which strategies to use and when: Start by thinking of the strategies that will protect your business's core. If, for example, a first-mover advantage is within reach, making yourself more committed to intellectual property could be the answer. If you and your rivals are equally matched, ask yourself, ""Can those that threaten me with copying be copied in turn?"" The knowledge that each of you can hurt the other may dampen the competitive intensity or even lead to voluntary sharing of property. If these solutions fail or don't apply, try forging a connection with a product or business closely related to your own. Doing so may prevent a valued asset from falling into a rival's hands or make the asset harder to misappropriate. This approach can even help you expand your piece of the market pie or reduce the cost of making the threatened product, perhaps to the point where you can compete against pirated goods. Finally, if there still doesn't seem to be a way of making money from your threatened product, you may choose to move into the very business that has hurt your own.

Many start-ups have offered untenably low prices in a rush to capture first-mover advantage. Many incumbents have simply charged the same prices on-line as they do off-line. Either way, companies are missing a big opportunity. The fundamental value of the Internet lies not in lowering prices or making them consistent but in optimizing them. After all, if it's easy for customers to compare prices on the Internet, it's also easy for companies to track customers' behavior and adjust prices accordingly. The Net lets companies optimize prices in three ways. First, it lets them set and announce prices with greater precision. Different prices can be tested easily, and customers' responses can be collected instantly. Companies can set the most profitable prices, and they can tap into previously hidden customer demand. Second, because it's so easy to change prices on the Internet, companies can adjust prices in response to even small fluctuations in market conditions, customer demand, or competitors' behavior. Third, companies can use the clickstream data and purchase histories that it collects through the Internet to segment customers quickly. Then it can offer segment-specific prices or promotions immediately.

Rather than focus on profits, they have chased customers indiscriminately through discounting, channel incentives, and advertising. Rather than concentrate on delivering value that earns an attractive price from customers, they have pursued indirect revenues such as advertising and click-through fees. Rather than make trade-offs, they have rushed to offer every conceivable product or service. It did not have to be this way--and it does not have to be in the future. When it comes to reinforcing a distinctive strategy, Michael Porter argues, the Internet provides a better technological platform than previous generations of IT. Gaining competitive advantage does not require a radically new approach to business; it requires building on the proven principles of effective strategy. Porter argues that, contrary to recent thought, the Internet is not disruptive to most existing industries and established companies. It rarely nullifies important sources of competitive advantage in an industry; it often makes them even more valuable. And as all companies embrace Internet technology, the Internet itself will be neutralized as a source of advantage. Robust competitive advantages will arise instead from traditional strengths such as unique products, proprietary content, and distinctive physical activities. Internet technology may be able to fortify those advantages, but it is unlikely to supplant them. Porter debunks such Internet myths as first-mover advantage, the power of virtual companies, and the multiplying rewards of network effects. He disentangles the distorted signals from the marketplace, explains why the Internet complements rather than cannibalizes existing ways of doing business, and outlines strategic imperatives for dot-coms and traditional companies.

The Half-Truth of First-Mover Advantage.,"Suarez, Fernando; Lanzolla, Gianvito",Harvard Business Review,00178012,,Apr2005,83,4,121,7,16572727,,Harvard University,Article,Market entry; New product development -- Marketing; Competitive advantage in business; Product acceptance; Management; Product management; Marketing; Strategic planning; Technological innovations; Business intelligence; Administrative Management and General Management Consulting Services; Marketing Consulting Services; Competition,,"Many executives take for granted that the first company in a new product category gets an unbeatable head start and reaps long-lasting benefits. But that doesn't always happen. The authors of this article discovered that much depends on the pace at which the category's technology is changing and the speed at which the market is evolving. By analyzing these two factors, companies can improve their odds of succeeding as first movers with the resources they possess. Gradual evolution in both the technology and the market provides a first mover with the best conditions for creating a dominant position that is long lasting (Hoover in the vacuum cleaner industry is a good example). In such calm waters, a company can defend its advantages even without exceptional skills or extensive financial resources. When the market is changing rapidly and the product isn't, a first entrant with extensive resources can obtain a long-lasting advantage (as Sony did with its Walkman personal stereo); a company with only limited resources probably must settle for a short-term benefit. When the market is static but the product is changing constantly, first-mover advantages of either kind--durable or short-lived--are unlikely. Only companies with very deep pockets can survive (think of Sony and the digital cameras it pioneered). Rapid churn in both the technology and the market creates the worst conditions. But if companies have an acute sense of when to exit -- as Netscape demonstrated when it agreed to be acquired by AOL--a worthwhile short-term gain is possible. Before venturing into a newly forming market, you need to analyze the environment, assess your resources, then determine which type of first-mover advantage is most achievable. Once you've gone into the water, you have no choice but to swim.",FT50,Y

The predominance of low-quality goods and services in developing nations and the support of governments often allow pioneers to seize the best production sites, distribution channels, and market niches. Looking at the technological advantages that attract would-be pioneers, the researchers urge prudence. The study indicates a condition that can work against the technological advantages offered by emerging markets: Many developing nations have minimal patent and trademark protection and have difficulty enforcing commercial laws.",FT50,Y

How Local Companies Keep Multinationals AT BAY.,"Bhattacharya, Arindam K.; Michael, David C.",Harvard Business Review,00178012,,Mar2008,86,3,84,12,30028332,,Harvard University,Article,International competition; Strategic planning; Business models; Economies of scope; Glocalization; Competitive advantage in business; Emerging markets; Success in business; Corporate growth; International markets; Follower advantage; First-mover advantage; Globalization; Innovation adoption,,"A substantial number of local companies in emerging markets have managed to hold their own -- or better -- in the face of competition from global Goliaths. Bhattacharya and Michael of the Boston Consulting Group show how these domestic Davids have achieved that impressive feat. The secret is to adopt most, if not all, elements of a six-part strategy. One, the homegrown winners customize products and services to meet local needs and initially go after economies of scope. Two, they develop business models to overcome market-specific obstacles and gain competitive advantage in the process. Three, they create or buy the latest technologies and use them effectively. Four, they find ways to benefit from low-cost labor and train workers inhouse to overcome shortages of skilled employees. Five, they scale quickly by going national before regional rivals can challenge them. Six, they invest in top management talent in order to sustain rapid growth. No element on its own is groundbreaking, but in the aggregate the strategy is a potent one, as the authors illustrate with the story of Ctrip, China's largest online travel agent. Successful as homegrown champions have been -- and this article identifies 50 of them -- a few multinationals, such as Yum Brands, Nokia, and Hyundai, have managed to beat the locals at their own game by using the six-part strategy. Global companies would do well to study these models of achievement and, armed with acquired wisdom, rethink their own strategies before local rivals shut them out of lucrative emerging markets.",FT50,Y

Established firms may defer entering the Internet marketplace until it is too late, waiting for technology to reach a certain level of ease of use and reliability. By contrast, a company can move too quickly and impede itself by choosing the wrong kind of technology to drive their online marketing initiatives. Firms should avoid the natural reluctance to attempt things that might detract from their core business. Commercial concerns should set up new divisions to deal exclusively with new technology marketing ventures. A number of early set-backs in Internet marketing schemes might lead to a reduction in persistence on the part of businesses.",FT50,Y

The desire to create new products pervades business today. Levitt argued, however, that the success of most companies lies more on imitation than innovation. He believes that being a fast follower is a more dependable approach than being a first mover. No company could reasonably afford to be as constant an innovator as it is compelled to be an imitator. It makes sense to have a carefully developed method of planning innovative imitation as it is of planning innovation itself.",FT50,Y
